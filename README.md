- API integration and redux toolkit implemented.
- Unit test for product list.
- Clean & smart code.
- SEO Optimization using SSR rendering.

The only thing not implemented is fetching users cart when they login, thats because "https://fakestoreapi.com/carts/user/2" api does not provide with products it just sends product id and quantity in response, Its api and slices are implemented but to due its response i commented its implementation.
